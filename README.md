		Preventive  measures for the natural calamities
 
INTRODUCTION 

		The aim is to protect people from suffering and reduce economic loss during any natural disasters.

	
Phase -1
		Our first and foremost idea is to create an application  which helps people in communicating  with their family members and send them their location(kind of SOS).so that they can communicate with the nearest rescue team in case of any calamities.


Phase -2
		 Concentrate in the field of construction of buildings which are not prone or less prone to damages.Buildings with suspensions with which it can synchronize the vibrations of an earthquake.

As humans we are the cause for most of the natural disasters and we should reduce it by using eco freindly methods like solar fuel plants ect..,
