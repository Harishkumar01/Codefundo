		Preventive  measures for the natural calamities
 
INTRODUCTION 

		The aim is to protect people from suffering and reduce economic loss during any natural disasters.

	
Phase -1
		Our first and foremost idea is to create an application  which helps people in communicating  with their family members and send them their location(kind of SOS).so that they can communicate with the nearest rescue team in case of any calamities.


Phase -2
		 Concentrate in the field of construction of buildings which are not prone or less prone to damages.Buildings with suspensions with which it can synchronize the vibrations of an earthquake.

As humans we are the cause for most of the natural disasters and we should reduce it by using eco freindly methods like solar fuel plants ect..,

THEME
            
            Electronic Voting.
            
AIM
            
            Implementing Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain.
            
IMPLEMENTATION:
            An interface which enables voters to enter their credentials which is collectively validated and stored in a block.The block is then added to the existing chain if it satisfies all the requirements of the voting process.
            Having RSA encryption working on the interface, privacy of electors is preserved. A digital ledger would contain electoral information and hence is unhackable. Only possible way infilteration could occur would be when the interface of any node is compromised and this wouldn't affect the blockchain.The voter ID acts as Unique key for each voter.
            With these functionalities into implementation, the voting system becomes safe, reliable, secure and more importantly genuine and transparent.
